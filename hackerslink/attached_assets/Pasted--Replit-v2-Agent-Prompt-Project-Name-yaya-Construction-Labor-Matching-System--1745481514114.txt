🏗️ Replit v2 Agent Prompt 

Project Name: 

yaya! — Construction Labor Matching System 

 

🌟 Goal: 

Build a hackathon prototype of a real-time construction job matching MVP that connects contractors to skilled workers using Africa’s Talking USSD and SMS APIs. 

⚠️ This is a lean prototype — focus on core functionalities, not a fully-fledged product. 

🎨 Prototype should have simple but appealing aesthetics — construction theme, icons, and relevant background image. 

 

📂 Category: 

Workforce Management 

🛠️ Tech Stack Preference: 

Frontend: Minimalist React app (if needed) 

Backend: Simple and effective logic for matching and SMS dispatch 

Priority: USSD/SMS backend logic and Africa's Talking integration 

 

🛏️ Problem: 

Contractors often can’t find skilled laborers in time. 

 Workers miss job opportunities due to limited access to smartphones, internet, or airtime. 

 

✅ Solution: 

A lightweight USSD-based system that: 

Lets contractors post jobs via mobile USSD or web 

Lets workers register via USSD with skills and location 

Matches workers to jobs in real time based on skill + location 

Sends SMS notifications to selected workers 

 

💡 MVP Plan 

1. Contractor Job Posting 

Interface: Mobile USSD or web form 

Inputs: Skill needed, location (use real Kenyan locations e.g. Pipeline, Gikambura) 

Action: Save job post to DB 

API: Africa’s Talking USSD 

2. Worker Registration 

Interface: USSD 

Inputs: Name, skill type (e.g. Mason), location 

Action: Save to DB 

API: Africa’s Talking USSD 

3. Matching Logic 

On job post, fetch workers who match skill + location 

Select top 2-3 workers 

4. SMS Notifications 

Message: "Job: Mason needed in Pipeline. Call 07xx..." 

API: Africa’s Talking SMS 

5. (Optional) Worker Response 

Worker can reply via SMS or call contractor directly 

 

🧪 Demo Flow 

Worker dials *123# 

Registers: name, skill = Mason, location = Pipeline 

Contractor posts: “Need mason in Pipeline” 

System fetches 2 matches 

SMS sent to workers with job + contractor number 

Worker calls contractor → connection made 

 

⚙️ Technologies 

Africa’s Talking APIs 

USSD: to receive input from contractors and workers 

SMS: to notify matched workers 

Backend: 

Express.js / Node.js  

Frontend (optional): 

Minimal React App 

Construction-themed styling (icons, background image) 

Hosting: 

Replit backend  

 

🔐 Credentials (replace placeholders): 

AFRICASTALKING_USERNAME=your_username_here   
AFRICASTALKING_API_KEY=your_api_key_here 
  

 

🧪 Output Required: 

A working demo of the MVP that: 

Provides test endpoints for USSD + SMS flows via Africa’s Talking 

Demonstrates job creation, worker registration, matching, and SMS notifications 

Has simple UI with construction theme (if frontend used)
